# Databse basics(java)
compulsory

I solved the compulsory part for 8th laboratory. 
Database class is singleton, and creates the connection with the MySQL database that I created, with the name MusicAlbums . 
I removed the local password from the configuration string. (user and password should have been "dba" , "sql" )  
ArtistController class has the specific methods for artist table added in the database. (analog for AlbumController for table album) 
I added 2 screenshots for the results and table in the database . 
I created a javadoc with the public methods .
